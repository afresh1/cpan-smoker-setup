$success = updatedir($dir)
"updatedir()" takes a directory name as argument and writes a typical
"CHECKSUMS" file in that directory as used on CPAN unless a previously
written "CHECKSUMS" file is there that is still valid. Returns 2 if a
new "CHECKSUMS" file has been written, 1 if a valid "CHECKSUMS" file
is already there, otherwise dies.
