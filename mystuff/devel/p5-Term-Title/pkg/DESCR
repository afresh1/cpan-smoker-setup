Term::Title provides an abstraction for setting the titlebar or the tab
title across different types of terminals. For *nix terminals, it prints
the appropriate escape sequences to set the terminal or tab title based
on the value of $ENV{TERM}. On Windows, it uses Win32::Console to set
the title directly.
