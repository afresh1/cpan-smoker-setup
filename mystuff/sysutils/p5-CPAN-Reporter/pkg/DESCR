The CPAN Testers project captures and analyzes detailed results from
building and testing CPAN distributions on multiple operating systems
and multiple versions of Perl. This provides valuable feedback to module
authors and potential users to identify bugs or platform compatibility
issues and improves the overall quality and value of CPAN.
